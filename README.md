What: This public repository consists of a set of algorithms to be used in conjunction with payment systems in retail stores selling delis, prepared foods and other perishable products ("Products") with expiration date and time (EDT) data.

Why: (1) Society: Food supply is a process that leaves a carbon footprint along the supply chain. Reducing food loss can help reduce this footprint. (2) Businesses: can reduce inventory loss due to expiration. (3) Consumers: can save money by choosing to purchase products that are nearing EDT.

How: Perform the following two main steps before Products are placed on the store shelves: (1) enter ETD data into the inventory system and (2) implement the set of algorithms in this repository which set forth a predefined discount rate corresponding to time-to-ETD at checkout for each Product type. Once these steps have been performed, a discount will be applied to each registered Product that is nearing its ETD when it is scanned at checkout.
